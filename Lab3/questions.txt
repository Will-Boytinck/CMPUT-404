1. https://github.com/Will-Boytinck/CMPUT-404/tree/main/Lab3
2. We are shown the startup page for Django Admin
3. “/” gives a 404 File Not Found error, “/polls” shows the view we just created
4. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to our models. We need them to create the tables to store our models
5. When you log into the Django administration site, we are able to see all the models and their information in the database. Custom models become visible after registering them
6.  "/polls/38/ , "/polls/38/results" and give a 404 Not Found error. "/polls/38/vote" gives a 404 Not Found a str is used instead of a number. We can modify the urls.py file doing "<int:pk> -> <str:pk>"
7. Because something (ex. A dependency, or user story…)  can change, and you will have to refactor everything – That is both time consuming and error prone
8. Generic Views reduce boilerplate code when you repeatedly use the same code in several views. 
   This saves time and reduces needless complexity over regular views. 
   Generic views should not be used when you need to create a custom webpage with lots of moving elements and unique code
